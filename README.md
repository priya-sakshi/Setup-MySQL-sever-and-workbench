# Setup MySQL server and workbench

**MySQL Server:**

MySQL Server is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used for managing and storing structured data. It's a critical component of the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl) stack, making it a popular choice for web applications and various other software systems.
MySQL Server is a relational database management system, and MySQL Workbench is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool for interacting with MySQL databases.

Key features of MySQL Server:

1. **Relational Database**: MySQL stores data in tables with rows and columns, making it easy to organize and retrieve data.

2. **SQL Support:** MySQL uses the Structured Query Language (SQL) for managing and querying databases. It supports SQL standards, making it compatible with various applications and tools.

3. **Data Security:** MySQL provides robust authentication and access control mechanisms to ensure data security.

4. **Scalability:** MySQL is known for its scalability, allowing you to handle large datasets and high volumes of concurrent users.

5. **High Performance:** It's designed for high performance and efficiency, making it suitable for demanding applications.

**MySQL Workbench:**

MySQL Workbench is an integrated development environment (IDE) and graphical user interface (GUI) tool for working with MySQL databases. It simplifies database design, development, and administration tasks, making it easier for developers and database administrators to interact with MySQL.

Key features of MySQL Workbench:

1. **Database Design:** MySQL Workbench provides tools for designing, modeling, and visually creating database schemas, tables, and relationships.

2. **SQL Editor:** It includes a built-in SQL editor with syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and query execution capabilities.

3. **Data Modeling:** You can create and visualize entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) to design your database schema.

4. **Database Administration:** MySQL Workbench allows you to manage user accounts, set privileges, and monitor server performance.

5. **Data Migration:** You can migrate data from other database systems to MySQL using data migration wizards.

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

1. A local computer running a supported operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2. Administrative access to your computer.
